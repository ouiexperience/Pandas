# In general ad A was clicked more often than ad b. Only on Tuesday did ad B take the lead by being cliqued 37.82% compared to ad A 36.13% Overall Ad A is recommended to get people to click on the advertisement and learn more about the product. Now, we do not know if the people clicked baught the product. If the goal of the advertisement was to create awareness I would recommend Advertisement A. If the goal is to sell the product more analytics must be completed to see the percentage of the people that clicked actually baught the product. Maybe the ad was not targeted to the right audience.
